1
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,386
Please. Please.

2
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,972
-I have credits. Take them.

3
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,735
He says you spilled his drink.

4
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,742
It's fine.

5
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,827
-It's on me.

6
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,335
Here.

7
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,494
Thank you! Thank you very much!

8
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,289
You have my heartfelt gratitude.

9
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,254
You know what? Here.

10
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,713
You take my credits.

11
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,757
Buy yourself a drink.

12
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,594
Oh.

13
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,929
Is that a bounty puck?

14
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,767
Is that me?

15
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,397
Look...

16
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,524
Uh, there must be some mistake.

17
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,234
I can get you more credits.

18
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,861
I can bring you in warm...

19
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,406
Or I can bring you in cold.

20
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,641
I need passage to the yards.

21
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,491
No droids.

22
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,395
Where to?

23
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,287
You know what he's looking for?

24
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,289
You're looking for Ravinaks, right?

25
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,291
It's clear right now.

26
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,127
But be careful near the port.

27
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,922
Everyone dumps their Gray Holds out.

28
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:01,134
They think the whole entire planet
is their own personal stink pit.

29
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,813
Here you are.

30
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,067
-You're kidding me, right?
Get out.

31
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,029
I'll hire us a Livery Cruiser.

32
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,156
No big deal.
It won't come out of your end.

33
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,491
I'll pay for it.

34
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,994
I'm just trying to make it pleasant.

35
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,162
Hey, it's time to go, so let's settle up.

36
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,460
I'd stay off the ice if I were you.

37
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,299
You think there's really something
to worry about?

38
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,106
Open the hatch! Open the hatch!

39
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,209
Dank farrik, that was close!

40
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,711
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,795
"Stay off the ice."

42
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,756
That's the understatement
of the millennium.

43
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,224
It's taking us down. What're you doing?

44
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,188
It's got us. It's gonna take us under.

45
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,440
Where you going?

46
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,567
You gotta do something!
We gotta get out of here!

47
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,006
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

48
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,716
Yes. All right.

49
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,860
Whew.

50
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,698
I like your ship. She's a classic.

51
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,034
Razor Crest, am I right?

52
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,620
Pre-Empire?

53
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,916
I have a lot of credits, by the way.

54
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,960
That's why I offered to hail a Cruiser.

55
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,968
How much are they paying you?

56
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,766
Is it true that you guys
never take off your helmets?

57
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,980
Boy.

58
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,609
I think I have to use the vacc tube.

59
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,904
I mean I can do it here,

60
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,033
but if you've never seen
a Fledgling Mythrol evacuate their thorax,

61
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,618
you're a lucky guy, trust me.

62
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,958
Clearly, there's nowhere for me to go.

63
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,460
So, uh...

64
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,630
I'm gonna look for that vacc tube
if it's all the same to you?

65
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,757
Great.

66
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,230
Found it!

67
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,441
Thanks. It might take a while.

68
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,901
I'm molting.

69
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,129
Oh, this feels a lot better.

70
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,049
I haven't evacuated since the solstice.

71
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:15,722
Yeah.

72
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,934
I was hoping to be free for Life Day.

73
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,144
Maybe even, uh...

74
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,819
Get home to the family.

75
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,120
But I guess that's
not gonna happen this year.

76
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,538
Probably not.

77
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,901
Ah, that was fast.

78
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,111
Did you catch them all?

79
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,744
Good. I'll begin the off-load.

80
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,632
These are Imperial Credits.

81
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,425
They still spend.

82
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,845
I don't know if you heard,
but the Empire is gone.

83
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,763
It's all I've got.

84
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,851
Save the theatrics.

85
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,644
Fine, I'll...

86
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,481
I can do Calamari Flan...

87
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,859
But I can only pay half.

88
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,530
Fine.

89
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,675
Hmm.
I have a bail jumper...

90
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,386
A bail jumper,

91
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,182
another bail jumper, a wanted smuggler.

92
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,474
I'll take them all.

93
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,809
No. Hold on.

94
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,689
There are other members of the Guild,
and this is all I have.

95
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,024
Why so slow?

96
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,526
It's not slow at all, actually. Very busy.

97
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,945
They just don't want to pay Guild rates.

98
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,573
They don't mind if things get sloppy.

99
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,076
-What's your highest bounty?
-Not much.

100
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,786
Five thousand.

101
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,955
That won't even cover fuel these days.

102
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,790
Hmm.

103
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,586
There is one job.

104
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,924
Let's see the puck.

105
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,509
No puck.

106
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,385
Face to face.

107
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:41,970
Direct commission.

108
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,056
Deep pocket.

109
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,599
Underworld?

110
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,437
All I know is no chain code.

111
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,358
Do you want the chit or not?

112
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,118
Greef Karga said you were coming.

113
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,211
What else did he say?

114
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,631
He said you were the best in the parsec.

115
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:46,970
Freeze!
-No!

116
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,055
Drop your weapons!

117
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,182
No, no, no, no.
Pardon. Uh, sorry.

118
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,268
I didn't mean to alarm.

119
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,939
This is Doctor Pershing.

120
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,692
Please excuse his lack of decorum.

121
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,364
His enthusiasm outweighs his discretion.

122
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,574
Please lower your blaster.

123
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,493
Have them lower theirs first.

124
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,286
We have you four to one.

125
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,413
I like those odds.

126
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,754
He also said you were expensive.

127
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,881
Very expensive.

128
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,550
Please sit.

129
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,659
Beskar?

130
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,953
Go ahead. It's real.

131
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,166
This is only a down payment.

132
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:04,423
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

133
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,507
Alive.

134
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,384
Yes. Alive.

135
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,761
Although, I acknowledge

136
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,640
that bounty hunting
is a complicated profession.

137
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,893
This being the case,

138
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:21,732
proof of termination is also acceptable
for a lower fee.

139
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,443
That is not what we agreed upon.

140
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,321
I'm simply being pragmatic.

141
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,240
Let's see the puck.

142
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,493
I'm afraid discretion dictates

143
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,955
a less traditional agreement.

144
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,000
We can only offer you a tracking fob.

145
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,173
What's the chain code?

146
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,927
We can only provide the last four digits.

147
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,764
Their age? That's all you can give me?

148
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,184
Yes. They're 50 years old.

149
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,813
We can also give you
last reported positional data.

150
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,733
Between that and the fob,

151
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:08,612
a man of your skill
should make short work of this.

152
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:22,751
The Beskar belongs back
into the hands of a Mandalorian.

153
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,713
It is good to restore
the natural order of things

154
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,299
after a period of such disarray,

155
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,677
don't you agree?

156
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,516
This was gathered
in the Great Purge.

157
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,352
It is good it is back with the Tribe.

158
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,104
Yes.

159
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,982
A pauldron would be in order.

160
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,069
-Has your signet been revealed?
-Not yet.

161
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,988
Soon.

162
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:35,068
This is extremely generous.
The excess will sponsor many Foundlings.

163
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,070
That's good.

164
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,656
I was once a Foundling.

165
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,782
I know.

166
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,709
Thank you.

167
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,088
You are a bounty hunter.

168
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,298
Yes.

169
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,679
I will help you.

170
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,016
I have spoken.

171
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,369
Many have passed through.

172
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,913
They seek the same one as you.

173
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,748
Did you help them?

174
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,292
Yes.

175
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,127
They died.

176
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,839
Well, then I don't know
if I want your help.

177
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,508
You do.

178
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,052
I can show you to the encampment.

179
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:30,721
What's your cut?

180
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:31,972
Half.

181
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,558
Half the bounty to guide? Seems steep.

182
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:38,604
No. Half of the blurrg you helped capture.

183
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,023
The blurrg? You can keep them both.

184
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,816
No, you will need one.

185
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:44,693
To ride.

186
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:48,572
The way is impossible to pass
without a blurrg mount.

187
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,200
I don't know how to ride blurrg.

188
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,785
I have spoken.

189
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,880
Perhaps if you removed your helmet.

190
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,382
Perhaps he remembers I tried to roast him.

191
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,221
This is a female.
The males are all eaten during mating.

192
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,085
I don't have time for this.

193
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,630
Do you have a Landspeeder
or Speeder bike that I could hire?

194
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,090
You are Mandalorian!

195
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:53,095
Your ancestors rode the great Mythosaur.

196
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,057
Surely you can ride this young foal.

197
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,076
Easy. Easy.

198
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,955
-Now, all right. Settle down.

199
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,040
Whoa!

200
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,585
Settle. Settle.

201
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:27,963
That's good. That's good.

202
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,427
Easy. Okay.

203
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,846
That's good.

204
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,265
All right.

205
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,570
Oh!

206
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,372
That is where you'll find your quarry.

207
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,254
Please. You deserve this.

208
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,381
Since these ones arrived,

209
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,342
this territory has been an endless stream

210
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:59,721
of mercenaries seeking reward
and bringing destruction.

211
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,140
Then why did you guide me?

212
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:04,101
They do not belong here.

213
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,104
Those that live here come to seek peace.

214
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:10,274
There will be no peace until they're gone.

215
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,526
Then why do you help?

216
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,904
I have never met a Mandalorian.

217
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,407
I've only read the stories.

218
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:24,454
If they are true,
you will make quick work of it.

219
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:27,916
Then there will again be peace.

220
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,630
I have spoken.

221
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,465
Oh, no.

222
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,383
Bounty Droid.

223
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:22,304
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

224
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,474
compels you to immediately
produce said asset.

225
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,245
Droids.

226
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:52,167
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

227
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,087
compels you to immediately produce
said asset.

228
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,922
IG Unit! Stand down.

229
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,679
I'm in the Guild!

230
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,138
You are a Guild member?

231
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:08,100
I thought I was the only one
on assignment.

232
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,060
That makes two of us.

233
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,312
So much for the element of surprise.

234
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,064
Sadly, I must ask for your fob.

235
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,442
I have already issued the writ of seizure.
The bounty is mine.

236
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:21,113
Unless I'm mistaken,
you are, as of yet, empty-handed.

237
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,406
This is true.

238
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,575
I have a suggestion.
-Proceed.

239
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,034
We split the reward.

240
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,287
This is acceptable.

241
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,332
Great. Now let's regroup,
out of harm's way, and form a plan.

242
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,294
I will of course receive
the reputation merits

243
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:36,795
associated with the mission.

244
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,463
Can we talk about this later?

245
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,010
I require an answer if I am to proceed...

246
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,262
Oh, no. Alert. Alert. Alert.

247
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,308
Oh!

248
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,648
Let's go!

249
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:18,795
He's in there!

250
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:19,922
Affirmative.

251
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,148
Up top!

252
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,746
It appears we are trapped.

253
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:56,375
I will initiate self-destruct sequencing.

254
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,253
Whoa, you're what?

255
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:02,256
Manufacturers Protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

256
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,551
-I must self-destruct.
-Do not self-destruct.

257
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,177
Cover me!

258
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,490
Go! Go! Go!
There's too many!

259
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,624
They got us pinned.

260
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,299
I will initiate self-destruct.

261
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:48,051
Do not self-destruct!
We're shooting our way out.

262
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,307
Okay.

263
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,518
New plan!

264
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,691
Beginning self-destruct countdown.

265
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:03,859
No! Stop it!

266
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,822
Draw their fire, I'll take it out.

267
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,407
Acceptable.
-Go!

268
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:43,774
Well done.

269
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:48,028
I will disengage self-destruct initiative.

270
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,408
You know, you're not so bad.

271
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,161
-For a droid.
Agreed.

272
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,455
That blaster hit looks nasty. You okay?

273
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,666
Running a quick diagnostic.

274
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,503
It has missed my central wiring harness.

275
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:05,587
Is that good?

276
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,339
Yes.

277
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:09,883
Well,
now we just need to get the door open.

278
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:41,748
Anyone else?

279
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,210
The tracking fob is still active.

280
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:48,755
My sensors indicate
that there is a life form present.

281
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,456
Wait.

282
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,249
They said 50 years old.

283
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,044
Species age differently.

284
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,507
Perhaps it could live many centuries.

285
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,886
Sadly, we'll never know.

286
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,304
No.

287
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,182
We'll bring it in alive.
